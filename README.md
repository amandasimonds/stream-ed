## Stream Ed

**A React application built to streamline all online education needs into one application. Please view at https://amandasimonds.github.io/stream-ed/**

As a teacher that was thrown into online teaching, I noticed a theme in issues parents, teachers, and students were having: they couldnâ€™t find things.
Assignments were on google classroom, live meetings were on zoom, and grades were on infinite campus. 
I thought it would be much easier for everything to be in one place, so I designed a layout that would do that. 
This is very much based off my own experience and feedback from students, teachers, and parents.

- Currently the layout is showing features for both students and parents. As we integrate authentication, the app will look differently depending on the user type.

- The #buttons are meant to be filters, so the user can view all or specific items.

- This project is in progress. While I have the wireframe, database, and mobile responsiveness layout carved out, I have set up the components so they are ready to be used dynamically. This is an app I am working on as I gain more experience with ReactJS.

Feel free to give me any suggestions.
