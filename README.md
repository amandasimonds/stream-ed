## Stream Ed

** A React application built to streamline all online education needs into one application. Please view at https://amandasimonds.github.io/stream-ed/

As a former teacher, thrown into online teaching during the current world situation, I've noticed a major flaw in our online school setup - That is putting things in different places, different webpages. THis causes confusion. I believe if everything, such as your schedule, announcements, live streams, assignments were in one webpage, it makes a more intuitive experience. The focus should be on learning and connecting, and not distracted by redirections in where things are.

- This project is in progress. While I have the wireframe and mobile responsiveness layout carved out, I have set up the components so they are ready to be used dynamically. This is an app I am working on as I gain more experience with ReactJS.

Feel free to give me any suggestions.
